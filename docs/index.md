## Research Experience

- William & Mary: Research assistant  `2023 - Now`
    - HPC telemetry analysis
        - Analyzed a large amount of real-world production telemetry data from OLCF, JLab clusters.
        - Proposed a predictive framework that adapts to diverse tasks, including anomaly detection and workload prediction.
        - Developed a method to reveal telemetry relationships, offering a holistic view of system behavior.
        - Analyzed the change of telemetry relationships relative to workload changes.
    - Resilience Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicle Models
        - Performed strategic resilience evaluation on an L4 autonomous driving system.
        - Examined the effectiveness of mitigation on critical faults in autonomous vehicles.
